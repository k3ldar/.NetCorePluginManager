<p>
The middleware module is a shared module which defines interfaces and classes that can be used by any plugin module.  Specifically the middleware module provides access to dynamic data obtained through the business object layer (BOL) and ultimately the data access layer (DAL).  
</p>
<p>
The advantage of using a middlware layer is that the application does not have to have any knowledge about the BOL that is used, the interfaces and classes are specific to the website and plugin modules that are being loaded.
</p>
<p>
The host application is responsible for implementing interfaces exposed using the middleware.

Please see the individual classes and interfaces for details on their useage.
