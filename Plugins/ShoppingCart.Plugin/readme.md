This package is one of many packages that can be used with [Plugin Manager](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PluginManager) which can be used to extend any c#/.net based application (MVC, Winform, WPF, MAUI etc) by using a [Modular Approach](https://pluginmanager.website/docs/Document/A-Modular-Approach/).

# Shopping Cart Plugin
The shopping cart plugin module is a fully featured shopping cart, that supports multiple payment types and has a natural and easy flow to guide users through the checkout process.

Currently the following payment providers are available:

- CashOnDelivery provider.
- Cheque provider.
- ClickAndCollect provider.
- DirectTransfer provider.
- Paypoint provider.
- Phone provider.

Payment providers are simple to integrate, they only need to be enabled with the settings. Certain payment providers will only be visible if the correct currency is used during checkout, however, the currencies supported by each provider is configurable.
