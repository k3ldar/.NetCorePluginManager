This package is one of many packages that can be used with [Plugin Manager](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PluginManager) which can be used to extend any c#/.net based application (MVC, Winform, WPF, MAUI etc) by using a [Modular Approach](https://pluginmanager.website/docs/Document/A-Modular-Approach/).

# Shared Plugin Features
The SharedPluginFeatures assembly contains interfaces that are shared between the Plugin Manager and all plugin assemblies. As well as this it also contains some basic base classes which can be used by Controllers, Models, Views and other middleware plugin assemblies.
